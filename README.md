## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains all four Operating Systems lab assignments completed as part of the 5th-semester curriculum.  
Each assignment showcases practical implementation of core OS concepts such as **process management, system calls, scheduling algorithms, memory allocation, file system operations, VM detection**, and more — using **C, Python, and Bash** in a Linux environment.

# ⚙️ Assignment 2 — Process Scheduling & Subtasks  
**Objective:** Implement CPU scheduling algorithms and multi-process subtasks.

### **Subtasks**
- Process creation & logging  
- Function execution using multiprocessing  
- Process synchronization (`join`)  
- Inter-process communication  

### **Scheduling Algorithms**
- FCFS  
- SJF  
- Round Robin

# 💾 Assignment 3 — Scheduling & Memory Management  
**Objective:** Extend OS concepts through scheduling and memory allocation.

### **Tasks**
- Task 1: Scheduling Simulation (Python)  
- Task 4: Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, First-Fit memory allocation  
- Task 5: MFT & MVT memory management  

### **Files Included**
